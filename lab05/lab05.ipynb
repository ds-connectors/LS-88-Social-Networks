Repeating the parameter set multiple times gives us a way to account for the fact that there is randomness to the ER networks that get generated. This will be clearer once you plot the results of the simulation below."

When `gc_frac` is 1, all of the nodes in the network are in the same component. So this result suggests that, when $p$ is big enough, an ER random network is very likely to be completely connected, i.e., made of one 'giant' component."
